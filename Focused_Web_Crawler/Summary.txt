Explanation:

1. How do you decide which links to put in your Frontier List and which to ignore.

I have a list of 5 words which I think are important to be in the document, if I need documents relevant to the topic given (Maritime disasters). I calculate the score of each document based on how many times these words appear in the document text. If the score of that particular document goes above the threshold that I have set, then it’s out-links go to the Frontier, else I ignore it’s outlines. Since this starts with the seed URL’s and they are compulsory to crawl, its outlines are validated and this holds true for each level of my frontier.

2. How do you decide which link to crawl next from your Frontier list.

There are 3 measures on which I decide which link to crawl first
- Relevance score
- In-degree count
- Waiting time in the Frontier list.

For each link , I first check its relevance and compare it with the following link in the Frontier list for the same depth. If the relevance score is the same, I check with the in-degree of the links. If that too is the same then I go with checking the waiting time of the links. The link that was longer in the queue, gets crawled first.
